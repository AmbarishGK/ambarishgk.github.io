Hi, I’m a graduate student at **San José State University**, currently pursuing my master’s degree in Computer Engineering.  
I was born and raised in **Chennai, India**, where I did my schooling and bachelor’s degree. Growing up in a vibrant city with beautiful beaches and incredible food shaped much of who I am today—I often spent my mornings cycling along the coast and watching sunrises.

After completing my bachelors, I moved to **Bangalore** and worked for a few years on projects ranging from **smart kitchen solutions** to **IoT fleet management** and **market analytics**. These experiences gave me a strong foundation in building end-to-end solutions and understanding how technology intersects with everyday life.

At SJSU, my research and projects focus on **AI/ML, robotics, computer vision, and IoT**. I’ve worked on projects involving **SLAM with ZED cameras and LiDAR**, **image forensics for detecting malicious content**, and **LLM-based document assistants**. Alongside my academic journey, I enjoy writing about technology and personal development on **Medium** and creating project walkthroughs on my **YouTube channel**.

When I’m not coding or experimenting with new tools, you’ll probably find me **training, exploring healthy cooking**, or **diving into books on psychology and strategy**.
